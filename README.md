# Binance-Trading-Bot-App-React-Native-Interface-
A mobile app that serves as an interface for a (server-side) quantitative algorithm linked to your Binance Account.

This app was created in React Native and aimed to serve as a controller for an algorithm that has access to your binance account via API keys. Using the app, you can monitor positions, see the order history and override any actions taken by the server-side quantitative algorithm. This app was created using the bare react native module (as opposed to the Managed workflow (Expo) module used to create Table4).

I also developed the server-side quantitative algorithm (Please see "Binance Trading Bot Algorithm" repository).
